WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ?

- Create a page which should contain search field in the top

- Once page is loaded it should have list of at least 12 movies

- Each movie should have image and a name (should be contained in array of objects)

- Once you type something in the search field, it should filter movies by name, and display only movies that match

BONUS:

Add remove icon to each movie. When icon is clicked, movie should be removed from the list
