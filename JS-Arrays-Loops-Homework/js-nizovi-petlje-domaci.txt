WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ?

TASK 1:

There are two arrays:

var dataOld = [34, true, "Peter", 1992];
var dataNew = [];

Repack old array to the new one, in the same order

Console log result

TASK 2:

There are two arrays:

var dataOld = [34, true, "Peter", 1992];
var dataNew = [];

Repack old array to the new one, in the reverse order

Console log result

TASK 3:

There are two arrays:

var dataOld = [34, true, "Peter", 1992];
var dataNew = [12, "Jack"];

Repack old array to the new one, so the data from two arrays is joined, starting with existing data from the new one.

TASK 4:

There are two arrays:

var a = [12, 56, 32, 44, 69];
var b = [88, 7, 13];

Create a new array that contains data from both arrays, starting with data from array a.

Console log result

TASK 5:

There are two arrays:

var a = [12, 56, 32, 44];
var b = [88, 7, 13];

Create a new array that contains data from both arrays, but in alternating order, one element from array a, then one element from array b, and so on. In the end it should look like this:

[12, 88, 56, 7, 32, 13, 44]

Console log result
